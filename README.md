### Hi there! 👋
I'm a primarily .NET Developer with 10+ years of experience, and I’m all about squeezing the most performance out of every line of code. I don’t just build software—I break it down, analyze how it executes, dive into the output of IL, and fine-tune it to make sure it runs as efficiently as possible. No CPU cycle being wasted

While my main programing lang C#, I’ve also spent a good amount of time working with JavaScript, Python, C++, reverse engineering, and fine-tuning AI models. And, I’m not just backend-heavy—I’ve got solid frontend skills too
