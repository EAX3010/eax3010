### Hi there! 👋

I'm a primarily .NET Developer with 10+ years of experience, obsessed with squeezing the most performance out of every line of code. I don’t just build software—I break it down, analyze how it executes, understand the output of IL, and fine-tune it for optimal memory efficiency. If a CPU cycle is wasted, it keeps me up at night.

I thrive on making distributed systems fast, scalable, and ridiculously efficient. Whether it’s cutting down execution time, reducing memory footprint, or ensuring minimal GC pressure, I’m always hunting for that extra bit of performance.

While my focus is backend development, I’ve also dabbled extensively in JavaScript, assembly, reverse engineering, Python, and fine-tuning AI models to run locally. I build interactive websites with AI-driven backends, and I also have solid knowledge of frontend technologies.

As any good programmer knows, when you truly understand how to code, the language becomes secondary—it’s all about logic and design, with just a few minor syntax differences.
